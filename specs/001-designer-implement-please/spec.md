- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
A form designer needs to create complex data collection forms without writing YAML manually. They use a visual drag-and-drop interface to:
1. Create form structure with pages and sections
2. Add widgets (fields, tables, grids, checklists, groups) by dragging from a palette
3. Configure widget properties through an inspector panel
4. Preview the form layout
5. Export the form definition as YAML compliant with DSL v0.1
6. Generate SQL schema for data storage

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** an empty designer canvas, **When** user creates a new form and adds a section, **Then** the section appears on the canvas ready to receive widgets

2. **Given** a section on the canvas, **When** user drags a "Field" widget from the palette and drops it into the section, **Then** the field widget appears in the section with default properties

3. **Given** a field widget is selected, **When** user modifies properties (name, label, type, required) in the inspector panel, **Then** the widget updates to reflect the new properties

4. **Given** a form with multiple widgets configured, **When** user clicks "Save", **Then** the form definition is persisted and can be reopened later

5. **Given** a saved form, **When** user clicks "Export YAML", **Then** a YAML file compliant with DSL v0.1 is generated and downloaded

6. **Given** a form with table widgets, **When** user clicks "Generate SQL", **Then** SQL DDL statements for data storage are generated

7. **Given** a form with unsaved changes, **When** user attempts to leave or close, **Then** system warns about unsaved changes

8. **Given** a table widget, **When** user adds columns with formulas, **Then** the column properties correctly store the formula expressions for later SQL generation

9. **Given** a multi-page form, **When** user adds/removes pages via page tabs, **Then** page navigation works correctly and widgets persist on their respective pages

10. **Given** an existing form, **When** user clicks "Open", **Then** the form loads with all pages, sections, and widgets restored to their saved state

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a user drags a widget to an invalid drop target?
  - Widget should not be added, drop zone should not accept it

- How does the system handle invalid property values (e.g., non-lowercase IDs)?
  - System should validate on input and show error messages

- What happens when exporting a form with no widgets?
  - System should generate valid but minimal YAML structure

- How are computed fields (formulas) validated?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should formula syntax be validated in real-time?]

- What is the maximum number of widgets, pages, or table columns?
  - [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Performance limits not specified]

- How are conflicting widget IDs handled?
  - System should enforce unique IDs or auto-rename conflicts

### Key Entities

- **Form Definition**: Represents a complete form with ID, title, version, locale settings, metadata (organization, document number, effective date, revision, reference, tags), options (print settings, permissions), storage configuration, and collection of pages

- **Page**: A logical grouping within a form containing ID, title, multilingual labels, and collection of sections. Forms can have multiple pages for complex workflows

- **Section**: A container within a page with ID, title, multilingual labels, and collection of widgets. Sections organize related widgets visually

- **Widget**: The base unit of form interaction. Types include:
  - **Field Widget**: Single data input with name, label, type, validation rules, placeholder, default value, unit, formula for computed values
  - **Group Widget**: Container for related fields with optional layout configuration (columns)
  - **Table Widget**: Repeating rows with defined columns, row mode (finite/infinite), min/max rows, row generators, aggregates
  - **Grid Widget**: Two-dimensional data entry with row/column generators and cell type specification
  - **Checklist Widget**: List of checkbox items with keys, labels, and types

- **Field Specification**: Data type definition including type (string, integer, decimal, date, time, datetime, bool, enum, etc.), constraints (required, readonly, min, max, pattern), enum values, default value, formula expression, formatting rules

- **Table Column**: Column definition within table widget with name, label, type, validation rules, formula expression, formatting

- **Form Metadata**: Organizational information including document number, effective date, revision number, reference links, tags for categorization

- **Storage Configuration**: Defines how form data is persisted including storage mode, header fields to copy to detail tables, index specifications

- **Row/Column Generators**: Mechanisms to dynamically generate table rows or grid dimensions based on ranges (integer, date/time) or value lists

**Assumptions:**
- Users have basic understanding of form design concepts
- Forms are primarily for data collection workflows
- YAML export is the primary integration mechanism
- SQL generation targets PostgreSQL dialect
- Browser environment supports HTML5 drag-and-drop
- Forms are designed once and rendered many times (design-time vs. runtime separation)

1. Create a complete multi-page form definition in under 30 minutes without writing code
2. Configure complex table widgets with 10+ columns including formulas
3. Export form as valid DSL v0.1 YAML that renders correctly in form engine
4. Generate SQL DDL that creates working database tables
5. Save and reopen forms without data loss
6. Understand form structure through visual representation alone

**System quality:**
