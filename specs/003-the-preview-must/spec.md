# Feature Specification: Preview Mode Fidelity Enhancement

**Feature Branch**: `003-the-preview-must`
**Created**: 2025-10-09
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "The preview must look like the real paper form. In preview mode the buttons like add, remove must be available and functional. the extra gaps and padding should be removed"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - High-Fidelity Preview Matching Paper Form (Priority: P1)

A form designer creates a digital form and wants to preview it to ensure it matches the original paper form layout exactly, so they can verify it's ready for production use.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - users need to trust that what they see in preview is exactly what users will see in production. Without accurate preview, designers waste time with trial-and-error adjustments.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by loading any existing form in preview mode and visually comparing it to the paper form reference. Delivers immediate value by enabling accurate form validation before deployment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a form with multiple fields is loaded in preview mode, **When** the designer views the preview, **Then** the spacing, padding, and layout matches the paper form with no extra whitespace
2. **Given** a multi-page form with tables, **When** the designer switches to preview mode, **Then** all elements appear with the same visual density as the paper form
3. **Given** a form with nested sections, **When** previewed, **Then** section borders, margins, and element spacing exactly match the paper form layout

### User Story 2 - Functional Interactive Elements in Preview (Priority: P1)

A form designer needs to test dynamic features (add row, remove row) in preview mode to ensure the form behaves correctly before deploying to end users.

**Why this priority**: Interactive elements like add/remove buttons are critical to many forms (e.g., shift rosters, expense reports). Designers must validate this functionality works correctly, making this equally critical as visual fidelity.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by opening a form with repeatable sections in preview mode, clicking add/remove buttons, and verifying rows are added/removed correctly. Delivers value by catching logic errors before production.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a form with repeatable table rows in preview mode, **When** the designer clicks "Add Row", **Then** a new row is inserted with proper styling and functionality
2. **Given** a table with multiple rows in preview, **When** the designer clicks "Remove" on a specific row, **Then** that row is deleted and remaining rows renumber correctly
3. **Given** a form with nested repeatable sections, **When** add/remove buttons are clicked, **Then** the changes are immediately reflected without requiring mode switching

### User Story 3 - Clean Visual Presentation (Priority: P2)

A form designer shares preview mode with stakeholders to get approval, and needs the preview to look professional without designer-mode artifacts like extra padding or spacing.

**Why this priority**: While functional testing (P1) is critical, professional presentation enables effective stakeholder review and approval. This is lower priority because the designer can mentally account for extra spacing, but it impacts collaboration quality.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by taking screenshots of preview mode and comparing padding/margins to design specifications. Delivers value by improving stakeholder confidence and reducing approval cycles.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a form loaded in preview mode, **When** viewing any section, **Then** there are no extra gaps between fields beyond what's specified in the form design
2. **Given** a complex form with mixed field types, **When** previewed, **Then** padding around labels, inputs, and buttons matches the paper form exactly
3. **Given** a form with custom styling, **When** toggling between designer and preview modes, **Then** preview mode removes all designer-specific padding and shows production styling only

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a repeatable section reaches a maximum row limit? (System should disable "Add" button or show appropriate message)
- How does the system handle add/remove operations when there's only one row remaining? (Prevent removal of last row or handle gracefully)
- What happens when switching from preview to designer mode after making changes (adding/removing rows)? (Changes should persist or user should be warned of loss)
- How does preview mode handle forms with conditional fields that depend on user input? (Preview should allow input to test conditionals)
- What happens to validation rules in preview mode? (Should they be active to allow full testing)

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: Preview mode MUST render forms with identical spacing, padding, and margins as the production/runtime view
- **FR-002**: Preview mode MUST display and enable all interactive buttons (Add Row, Remove Row, etc.) with full functionality
- **FR-003**: Preview mode MUST remove all designer-mode-specific visual artifacts including extra gaps, edit handles, and tooling overlays
- **FR-004**: Add Row functionality in preview mode MUST insert new rows that are immediately usable and properly styled
- **FR-005**: Remove Row functionality in preview mode MUST delete the target row and update any dependent row numbering or calculations
- **FR-006**: Preview mode MUST apply the same CSS styling and layout rules as the production runtime environment
- **FR-007**: Preview mode MUST handle repeatable sections (tables, lists) with the same behavior as production
- **FR-008**: System MUST maintain data entered in preview mode when toggling back to designer mode [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: should preview changes persist or reset?]
- **FR-009**: Preview mode MUST support testing of conditional field logic and validation rules
- **FR-010**: System MUST provide visual indication when in preview mode vs designer mode to prevent user confusion

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Preview Mode State**: Represents the current rendering mode (designer vs preview), controls which UI elements and styling are active
- **Repeatable Section**: Form elements that can have dynamic rows added/removed, includes reference to template row structure and current row count
- **Interactive Button**: Action elements (Add/Remove) with associated behavior, state (enabled/disabled), and styling rules
- **Layout Configuration**: Spacing, padding, margin specifications that differ between designer and preview modes

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Preview mode forms visually match paper form references with ≤2px deviation in spacing/padding measurements
- **SC-002**: 100% of Add/Remove button interactions in preview mode complete successfully without errors
- **SC-003**: Designers can validate complete form functionality in preview mode without needing to deploy to test environment, reducing testing time by 50%
- **SC-004**: Zero designer-mode-specific visual artifacts (extra padding, edit handles, tooling UI) appear in preview mode
- **SC-005**: Preview mode loads and renders forms within 2 seconds for typical forms (≤100 fields)
